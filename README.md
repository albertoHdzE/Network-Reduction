# Network-Reduction
Based on the work of mathematician Veliz-Cueva on [reduction of boolean networks](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21907211/), I implement in mathematica a methodology that reduce big networks in such a way that the reduced version of the original one reminds equivalent. This means that take irrelevant nodes that do not contricute to the generation of information
